Has the talk announcement gone out in http://ksucis.slack.com?  Please post it in #announcements and ask @weeser for a channel tag.  I suggest mentioning it in #acm, and you should definitely cross-post it to #acm-sigai.


@derekc: Can you please make the FB events under the SIGAI page?  One for Roman's talk, one for the workshop. Use the above materials. Thanks!
